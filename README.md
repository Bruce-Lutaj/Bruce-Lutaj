# Hey — I build reliable apps & clean systems 🔧📱

I started at the metal (C & C++) to build a solid CS foundation and now ship native Apple apps.  
Currently working as an **iOS native developer** — Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode and the entire Apple stack.  
I pair strong **DSA** skills with real-world product experience in agile (Scrum) environments using Git & Jira.
